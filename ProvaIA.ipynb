has been described many ways. They’ve been called “monkey dogs” and “ape terriers.” The French say diablotin moustachu (“mustached little devil”), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks.Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. “This isn’t a breed you train,” a professional dog handler tells us, “He’s like a human. You befriend him.” The dense, harsh coat is described as “neat but shaggy” and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs. The Affenpinscher: loyal, curious, and famously amusing; this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it’s the Affenpinscher’s apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.\n","temperament - Confident, Famously Funny, Fearless\n","popularity -

inches tall at the shoulder; Miniatures are 15 inches or under; Toys stand no more than 10 inches. All three varieties have the same build and proportions. At dog shows, Poodles are usually seen in the elaborate Continental Clip. Most pet owners prefer the simpler Sporting Clip, in which the coat is shorn to follow the outline of the squarely built, smoothly muscled body.Forget those old stereotypes of Poodles as sissy dogs. Poodles are eager, athletic, and wickedly smart “real dogs” of remarkable versatility. The Standard, with his greater size and strength, is the best all-around athlete of the family, but all Poodles can be trained with great success. Whether Standard, Miniature, or Toy, and either black, white, or apricot, the Poodle stands proudly among dogdom’s true aristocrats. Beneath the curly, low-allergen coat is an elegant athlete and companion for all reasons and seasons.                                                                                                     2\n","The Affen’s apish look has been described many ways. They’ve been called “monkey dogs” and “ape terriers.” The French say diablotin moustachu (“mustached little devil”), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks.Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. “This isn’t a breed you train,” a professional dog handler tells us, “He’s like a human. You befriend him.” The dense, harsh coat is described as “neat but shaggy” and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs. The Affenpinscher: loyal, curious, and famously amusing; this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it’s the Affenpinscher’s apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.                                                                       1\n","These big, bouncy hounds were ideally suited for otter hunting. OHs are built to be expert swimmers, from the top of their rough, waterproof coat to the bottom of their big webbed feet. A broad chest and powerful shoulders allow them to swim all day without tiring. Their large black nose is amazingly sensitive and could follow an otter’s underwater scent trail over great distances. And the OH’s size and strength enabled them to take on a sharp-toothed, razor-clawed otter that might weigh 20 pounds. Big, boisterous, and affectionate, the Otterhound was bred in medieval England for the now-outlawed activity of otter hunting. This scarce breed is known for his dense shaggy coat, webbed feet, acute sense of smell, and affinity for swimming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n","A moderately large-sized molossoid, with a rectilinear profile and black mask, the Perro de Presa Canario is robust and well-proportioned. With a low, deep bark, he has a balanced temperament and is very self-confident.  Obedient and docile with family members, he is very devoted to his master, but can be suspicious of strangers. When alert, his stance is firm and vigilant. The Perro de Presa Canario has a calm appearance and attentive expression. He is especially suited to guarding and traditionally used for herding cattle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n","At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day’s work. Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings.The Pembroke is a bright, sensitive dog who enjoys play with his human family and responds well to training. As herders bred to move cattle, they are fearless and independent. They are vigilant watchdogs, with acute senses and a “big dog” bark. Families who can meet their bold but kindly Pembroke’s need for activity and togetherness will never have a more loyal, loving pet. Among the most agreeable of all small housedogs, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a strong, athletic, and lively little herder who is affectionate and companionable without being needy. They are one of the world's most popular herding breeds.                                                                                                 1\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ..\n","The Dutch Shepherd was discovered as a naturally occurring shepherd’s dog living in rural areas. It was developed as an all-purpose farm dog, working originally as a farm guard, drover, and livestock dog. A well known dog fancier wrote about the Dutch Shepherd in 1910: “…bearing a great resemblance to the wolf.” Of course this is not entirely true, but it is another aspect that shows that the Dutch Shepherd still has many of the characteristics of its wild forebears. Although it is not a widely known breed, the Dutch Shepherd is a loyal companion and competent working dog used for obedience, dog sports, herding, tracking, search and rescue, and as a police dog. The Dutch Shepherd is a lively, athletic, alert and intelligent breed, and has retained its herding instinct for which it was originally developed. Having an independent nature, it can be slightly obstinate and have a mind of its own. Since its original duties were to keep flocks of sheep in a particular location, it is able to run all day, and that is reflected in its physique and structure.    1\n","The English Cocker Spaniel is a compactly built sporting dog standing between 15 to 17 inches at the shoulder. The softly contoured head, with its dark, melting eyes that convey an alert and dignified expression, is framed by lush, close-lying ears. The medium-length coat, seen in a variety of striking colors and patterns, is silky to the touch. “Balance” is a key word in understanding the breed: The EC is balanced in temperament, construction, and movement.Beneath the EC’s physical beauty beats the heart of a tireless, eager-to-please hunter’s helper, famous the world over for his ability to flush and retrieve gamebirds. For those who prefer more domestic pursuits, there is no more charming and agreeable household companion. English Cocker Spaniel lovers often use the word “merry” to describe their breed. Upbeat in the field and mellow at home, this compact, silky-coated bird dog is widely admired for his delightful personality and irresistible good looks.                                                                                                  1\n","The English Foxhound is the epitome of what serious dog breeders strive for: beauty, balance, and utility. “Next to an old Greek statue,” a poet wrote, “there are few such combinations of grace and strength as in a fine Foxhound.”These pack-oriented, scent-driven hounds are gentle and sociable, but rarely seen as house pets. They can be so driven by a primal instinct for pursuit that not much else, including training, matters to them. Owning these noble creatures is best left to huntsmen who kennel packs of hounds or to those experienced in meeting the special challenges of life with swift, powerful hounds hardwired for the chase. The English Foxhound is a substantial galloping hound of great stamina. His long legs are straight as a gatepost, and just as sturdy. The back is perfectly level. And the chest is very deep, “girthing” as much as 31 inches on a hound measuring 24 inches at the shoulder, ensuring plenty of lung power for a grueling day’s hunt.                                                                                                       1\n","English Setters are elegant but solid dogs of beauty and charm. The word “belton,” unique to the breed, describes the speckled coat patterns of colors that sound good enough to eat: liver, lemon, and orange among them. Under the showy coat is a well-balanced hunter standing about 25 inches at the shoulder.A graceful neck carries a long, oval-shaped head proudly, and dark brown eyes convey a soft expression. The merry English Setter is known as the gentleman of the dog world but is game and boisterous at play. English Setters get on well with other dogs and people. A veteran all-breed dog handler says, “As a breed to share one’s life and living space with, no other breed gives me more pleasure than the English Setter.” The English Setter is a medium-sized sporting dog of sweet temper and show-stopping good looks. It is one of the AKC’s four British setters created to work on the distinctly different terrains of England, Ireland, and Scotland.                                                                                                                  1\n","The Yorkshire Terrier is a compact, toy-size terrier of no more than seven pounds whose crowning glory is a floor-length, silky coat of steel blue and a rich golden tan.Don’t let the Yorkie’s daintiness fool you. Tenacious, feisty, brave, and sometimes bossy, the Yorkie exhibits all the traits of a true terrier. Often named the most popular dog breed in various American cities, Yorkies pack lots of big-town attitude into a small but self-important package. They are favorites of urbanites the world over.Yorkies are long-lived and low-allergen (the coat is more like human hair than animal fur), and they make fine little watchdogs. This is a true “personality breed,” providing years of laughs, love, and close companionship. Beneath the dainty, glossy, floor-length coat of a Yorkshire Terrier beats the heart of a feisty, old-time terrier. Yorkies earned their living as ratters in mines and mills long before they became the beribboned lapdogs of Victorian ladies.                                                                                                 1\n","Name: count, Length: 276, dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":74,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df[\"description\"].value_counts()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["OBS: A descrição as vezes é bem semelhante para animais de mesma raça, sendo completamente igual apenas uma vez para o Poodle (Miniature) e Poodle (Standard) (no Poodle (Toy) ela já varia um pouco), porém muitas vezes isso não acontece e as descrições acabam sendo strings bem longas, portanto achei que seria complicado tentar manter algum tipo de relação entre as descrições para ajudar na predição e achei melhor apenas desconsiderar a coluna mesmo"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":75,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["popularity\n","7      3\n","of     3\n","17     2\n","140    2\n","133    2\n","      ..\n","176    1\n","67     1\n","52     1\n","188    1\n","10     1\n","Name: count, Length: 191, dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":75,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df[\"popularity\"].value_counts()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":76,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Non-Sporting Group\n","Non-Sporting Group\n","Toy Group\n"]}],"source":["for _, element in df.loc[df[\"popularity\"] == \"7\"].iterrows():\n","    print(element[\"group\"])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":77,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Hound Group\n","Sporting Group\n","Working Group\n"]}],"source":["for _, element in df.loc[df[\"popularity\"] == \"of\"].iterrows():\n","    print(element[\"group\"])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":78,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Herding Group\n","Working Group\n"]}],"source":["for _, element in df.loc[df[\"popularity\"] == \"17\"].iterrows():\n","    print(element[\"group\"])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["OBS: O popularity as vezes se repete, porém essas repetições não aparentam ter uma relação muito direta com o \"group\" que é o nosso label, achei melhor tirar junto com os outros 2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":79,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["df_clean = df.drop(columns=[\"Unnamed: 0\", \"description\", \"popularity\"])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### 1.1 -
